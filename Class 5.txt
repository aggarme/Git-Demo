now another command groups maggarwal
groups maggarwal = will give grp name and users under that grp

another command id
id = tells which user id i am and what grp id i am

permissions:
there r three kinds of people who need permissions
1-directory or file owner = user = usually have ful permission
2-group = diff permission can be there for all user in that grp.
3-every body else - say linux admin who do nt need to view the data files


windows only 2 users can login to windows server at the same time. once third user tries to login to the same windows server , any one user has to be kicked out


now there are three different kinds of permissions:
1-read permission(r) - can read only, cannt make any chgs
2-write permission(w) - can update or make chges to the file
3-execute permission(x) - run the script 
so now normally ls -l gives smthing like below:
drwxr-xr-x
d=directory
rwx=these three r for user permissions
r-x=next three r for grp permission.this grp can r, cannt write, execute
r-x=further next three r for everybody else.

linux is case sensitive

now next command uptime
uptime = the time since when the server has been up.

PROCESS - when any task is running, processer will start, once task is finished processer will go away
so now in windows we can go to taskmanager to see all running processes. 
In linux also we have a command to do that

now new command is ps -ef
ps -ef = gives list of all processes that is running on that linux server
maggarwal = user name
second set of numbers = parent process id
third set of number = child process id
process ids r used to identify the process or even kill that process

now if you in one directory then how do u go to another directory
say you r in your directory and you want to go to root (/) directory
command change directory = cd /(location of the directory you want to go)
then enter, now type pwd again and check if u r in root(/) directory
cd command can be used only to go to another directory and not to the file

so now u r in root(\) and you want to go \home
so since ur already in \ you just command cd home (without -) since home in under \ and you r already in \

now next command - how to create a new directory
so say i have to create a new directory test in maggarwal directory
command mkdir test ( make sure u r in \home\maggarwal - use pwd to check that)

now lets create a blank file inside test directory
first go inside the test directory
cd test ( since u r already in maggarwal directory)
command = touch test.txt
then go to ts -l and you will see test.txt file there ( it starts with - since that is a file and not directory)

now lets try to copy file test.txt to test1.txt
command = cp test.txt test1.txt
then check doing ls -l , u will see two files test.txt and test1.txt

now lets delete the file 
command = rm test1.txt
then check again with ls -l , u will see onlu one file test.txt

now lets rename an existing file
command = mv test.txt test2.txt
copy (cp test.txt) will keep original file and create new but rename(mv test.txt) will rename the file name
